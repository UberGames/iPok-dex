# iPokédex for iOS
#### One of the most comprehensive unofficial Pokédex apps on iOS

## What is this?

iPokédex was an app I built in 2011 with the goal of being the most comprehensive Pokémon
reference app on the iOS App Store. Sadly, I received a C&D letter requesting it be taken down
and the app hasn't been publicly available since.

This is the complete source code of the iPokédex app, with all of the originally extracted information
(read copyright infringing) removed from the project.

The goal of open-sourcing this project is to allow other developers to use this code as an engine for other
projects.
